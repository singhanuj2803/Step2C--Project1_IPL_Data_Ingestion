### Summary 

Project One: Simplifying Data Processing in Azure Cloud with Data Factory, Functions, and SQL

This course is designed for professionals and data enthusiasts who want to learn how to effectively use Azure cloud services to simplify data processing. The course covers the use of Azure Data Factory, Azure Functions, and Azure SQL to create a powerful and efficient data pipeline.

You will learn how to use Azure Data Factory to extract data from various online storage systems and then use Azure Functions to validate the data. Once the data is validated, you will learn how to use Azure SQL to store and process the data. Along the way, you will also learn best practices and case studies to help you build your own real-world projects.

This project is designed for professionals who want to learn how to use Azure Data Factory for efficient data processing in the cloud. The project covers the use of Azure functions and Azure SQL database for validation of source schema in Azure Data Factory.

The course starts with an introduction to Azure Data Factory and its features.

You will learn how to create and configure an Azure Data Factory pipeline and how to use Azure functions to validate source schema.

You will also learn how to use the Azure SQL database to store and retrieve the schema validation details.

Throughout the project, you will work on hands-on exercises and real-world scenarios to gain hands-on experience in implementing Azure Data Factory for data processing. You will learn how to use Azure functions to validate the source schema and how to use the Azure SQL database to store and retrieve the schema validation details.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of Azure Data Factory and its capabilities, and you will be able to use it to validate source schema using Azure functions and Azure SQL database. This will enable you to design and implement efficient data processing solutions in the cloud using Azure Data Factory, Azure functions, and Azure SQL database."

This project is suitable for anyone with a basic understanding of data processing, who wants to learn how to use Azure cloud services to simplify data processing.
