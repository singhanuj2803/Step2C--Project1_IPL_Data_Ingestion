- Used Azure Data Factory to extract data from various online storage systems 
- Used Azure Functions to validate source schema and data.
- Used Azure SQL database (PAAS) to store and retrieve the schema validation details (Once the schema & data is validated,)

### Summary 

Project One: Simplifying Data Processing in Azure Cloud with Data Factory, Functions, and SQL

This Mini Project is designed for professionals and data enthusiasts who want to learn how to effectively use Azure cloud services to simplify data processing. 

**The mini project covers the use of Azure Data Factory, Azure Functions, and Azure SQL to create a powerful and efficient data pipeline.**

1. Demonstrated how to use Azure Data Factory to extract data from various online storage systems 
1. Demonstrated how to use Azure Functions to validate the data and source schema. 
1. Demonstrated how to use Azure SQL to store, process the data and retrieve the schema validation details

NOTE : Along the way, I have also demonstrated best practicesyour own real-world projects.

This project is designed for professionals who want to learn how to use Azure Data Factory for efficient data processing in the cloud. The project covers the use of Azure functions and Azure SQL database for validation of source schema in Azure Data Factory.

By the end of this mini project, you will have a solid understanding of Azure Data Factory and its capabilities, and you will be able to use it to validate source schema using Azure functions and Azure SQL database.
